						<h4>TESTING RESPONSIVE DESIGN</h4>
						<p>During the creation of my blog, I took my time on the home page. The homepage is where I experimented and testing code that I thought I could integrate into my original design. I decided to practice the responsive design of the header first using the logo as the main element to work with. Here I was trying to find the best size I could make the logo without making the page look too empty. This was also the stage I critisized my design because it looked too empy to me. The images show what it looks like when the screen size is minimized from its normal desktop screen view. </p><br>
