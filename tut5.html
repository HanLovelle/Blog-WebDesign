						<h4>FLEXBOX & RESPONSIVE DESIGN</h4>
						<p>For this tutorial I found it very useful because I was not familiar with how I could code to make a website responsive despite having some coding experience. The tutorial was straight forward so it was very easy to understand what was needed to be changed and added in order to make some or all elements in the page to be responsive. I had just edited some of the code in this tutorial because I wanted to put more effort on making a responsive design for my blog instead.I do think I still need to practice with flexbox because there are still variables that I am not familiar with or have not tried using.</p>
						<p>As shown in the image below, I have edited the code to change the bottom div background colour to a light blue, when the screen width is minimized. So this practice is a good start for me as I know I can experiment more on this for my blog. Things that I may incorporate for my blog relating to responsive design is making a container disappear and containers and text getting bigger or smaller. I think theres lots of smart ways to use this feature to make my blog more interesting, because at the moment my blog looks too simple and empty.</p>
