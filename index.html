			<p>My name is Hannah Loma and I'm passionate about design and technology. I'm constantly seeking new things to learn and try everyday. Generally I find design inspiration from nature which can be more evident in my 3D projects. I'd like to think that I make simple designs that portrays my care and individuality I put in creating them.
				I am a second year student studying at Victoria University of Wellington, majoring in Interaction Design. I am aspiring to become a UI/UX designer in the future, in hopes of becoming part of a team that improves the livelihood of the users. I'd love to make an impact of making people feel good with the product or services I have been apart of creating.</p>

			<h4>CURRENTLY DOING</h4>
			<p>Currently I am reading 'The Design of Everyday Things' by Don Norman. 
				I have been extremely inspired to create and try new art mediums. I have been practicing hand embroidery, which I have found surprisingly relaxing and enjoyable. I will also soon start experimenting with screen printing on paper and fabrics.</p>
