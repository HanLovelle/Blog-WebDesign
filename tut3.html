						<h4>STARTING MY BLOG</h4>
						<p>In this tutorial I had started coding my blog roughly. In this session I first completed my wireframes and prototype on figma as shown in the image below. I took a long time to decide on how I wanted my blog to look like. I decided for a simplistic design, althought I'm still hesitant that I'll stick with this design because once I start coding most of the blog it might look too empty and simple. But, so far my design style is placing my elements in the centre of the page. In a way my blog design layout was inspired by tutorial one, where I had recreated Etsy's website homepage. I liked the simplicity of their website and the layout.</p>
