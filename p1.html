						<h4>HOME PAGE DESIGN ONE</h4>
						<p>This way my original design, excactly what it looked like in my wireframes and prototype. Its simplistic and straight forward. It was simple to code as well as it didnt contain too many elements. I did find that it was too boring to look at after a while. What I found difficult with coding this design is the responsive design aspect. I had difficulty making sure I had the right layout and sizing when the device size gets smaller. The text for the navigation wouldn't drop down properly. I did almost get it right but I noticed that no matter what, for this design, it would look too emply despite the plan to have small graphics on the sides.</p>

						<div class="p1_2">

						</div>
						<h4>HOME PAGE DESIGN TWO</h4>
						<p>This second design I thought would have been a more interesting choice. However, I thought more about the accessibility of the navigation. It was also difficult at times to work in this type of abstract layout style. If I had more time and experience I probably would have gone for this, but I wanted to work efficiently. Another idea I had for this design was making the nav texts be graphics instead, and once you hover over the graphics the text "HOME" or "REFLECTION" would show. I would say this would be the most creative design, but it's hard to excecute with the skills I have at the moment since I have always gravitated to the traditional navigation design.</p>
						<div class="p1_3">

						</div>
						<h4>HOME PAGE DESIGN THREE</h4>
						<p>This is my chosen homepage design. I thought it would be better to incorporate my secondary colour (blue) in the graphics to make the website look more interesting. I opted for a traditional navigation design because its also easier to code as a responsive design. Originally, I planned to have a hamburger nav as shown in my prototype but I have decided to do that last once I finish at least the rest of my website. Going for this design allowed me to work more efficiently which I preferred.</p>
