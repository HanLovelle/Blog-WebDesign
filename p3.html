						<h4>JAVASCRIPT FOR UXHUB</h4>
						<p>I had never really coded javascript so it was a challenge for me. I had searched up on google and youtube to better understand how this could be done. I have coded in java, c++ and p5.js before so I understood most of what was happening in the code and the boolean used in it. I would not have an idea on how to do this on top of my head though, thats why I looked up on ways I could simply integrate the filter system. I didn't realise how different p5.js is to javascript. I had hopped and thought that I would be able to make the filter with p5.js because thats what I'm confortable in if it was possible.</p>
						<p>The javascript allows the user to click on a tag that they want to filter out in the UXHUB website. Then the relevant contents such as articles and videos would be filtered out. It is a simple concept, which I didn't realise would have a pretty complex code for beginers at javascript. It was simple enough to integrate the code that I found in tutorials online into my code for UXHUB.</p>
