						<h4>ETSY.COM</h4>
						<p>For the first tutorial work the task involved choosing a website to analyse and to recreate using HTML and CSS. I decided to analyse Etsy.com, a website which allows you to sell and buy handmade crafts from people around the world.<br><br>
						What I always noticed when using Etsy is how neat it looks. This is in terms of navigating the pages and looking for the information that you want. I noticed that they keep is simple and they use a good amount of while space to not make the website look cluttered, because essentially they are trying to present a large amount of information in their website from many users. The image above and below is what I have recreated using HTML and CSS. It was more evident in how much whitespace they decided to use once I coded the low fidelity wireframe of Etsy's homepage. I noticed that they liked to have the main elements centred, with the sub elements either taking up the whole width of the page or being left aligned.

						</div>
						<p>The first time I inspected Etsy's website code, it looked readable but it was also hard to read because I'm used to seeing it in a coding software instead, such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime. For me since I've already had experience in coding, it was essentially easy to code and place the divs where they were placed as shown in Etsy's website. However, what I always am struggling with was the responsiveness. I have slowly been getting used to adding responsive design to my websites but I had only started this trimester. So I found it difficult to understand what code will work so that the navigation would overflow to the next line. It was also hard sometimes to make sure the elements didnt have weird gaps inbetween them whenever I minimized or enlarged the webpage. But in the end I got there and managed to code the base wireframe of the home page as shown in the images above. It was a good refresher for me because it had been at least a year since I've hard coded in HTML and CSS.</p><br><br><p>07/07/20</p>
